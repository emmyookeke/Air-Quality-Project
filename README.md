ABOUT THE PROJECT:
Air quality is a critical determinant of public health, and Everyday activities, be it in industries, transportation, or homes, contribute to the introduction of pollutants into our surroundings. This underscores the pressing need for vigilant monitoring and predictive analysis of air quality, particularly in the vibrant and dynamic setting of New York. 
the New York State Department of Health has provided a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2005 to 2021, encompassing various parameters related to air quality. The project aims to employ predictive modelling techniques to analyze, forecast, and derive actionable insights from this extensive dataset. By understanding the interplay of factors such as vehicular emissions, industrial processes, and atmospheric conditions, we seek to provide a holistic view of air quality trends in New York City.
