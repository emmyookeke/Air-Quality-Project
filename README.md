Introduction  
Air quality is a critical determinant of public health, considering the crucial role it plays in the well-being of our communities. The relentless pace of advancements in various sectors has inadvertently taken a toll on the air we breathe. Everyday activities, be it in industries, transportation, or homes, contribute to the introduction of pollutants into our surroundings. This underscores the pressing need for vigilant monitoring and predictive analysis of air quality, particularly in the vibrant and dynamic setting of New York. The New York State Department of Health has provided a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2005 to 2021, encompassing various parameters related to air quality. This project aims to employ predictive modelling techniques to analyze, forecast, and derive actionable insights from this extensive dataset. By understanding the interplay of factors such as vehicular emissions, industrial processes, and atmospheric conditions, we seek to provide a holistic view of air quality trends in New York City.
This project aims to not only predict air quality trends but also to provide a nuanced understanding of the relationships between various parameters and their impact on public health. By incorporating diverse data sources, we aspire to contribute to the development of effective strategies for air quality management and public health improvement in New York City.
